## Welcome to the Stout CEE Website on GitHub Pages

This website is hosted on GitHub Pages and uses Jekyll. It is unlikely we will use this code on Luna (our Linux server). However, it may be nice to post information like links to Luna's IP Address and updates with the lab.

### Cool Things About GitHub Pages
 - We don't have to host anything
 - If Stout network goes down, this website is still up
 - If Luna goes down, this website is still up
 - Auto-generate pages with layouts (similar to how we use PHP for layouts)

### Not Cool Things About GitHub Pages
 - SLOW
 - Limited amount of traffic (per month?)
 - Limited amount of commits (per day?)
 - No server side scripts allowed (no PHP)
 - No database options (no MySQL)
